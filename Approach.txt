Design a parking lot which can hold n cars of different color and different registration numbers.
Every car needs to be issued a ticket for a spot and the spot has been assigned based on the nearest entry point.

The system should also return some queries such as:

* Registration numbers of all cars of a particular Color.
* Ticket number in which a car with a given registration number is placed.
* Ticket numbers of all ticket where a car of a particular color is placed.

# This should be simple command line utility with minimum these capabilities
- create a parking lot
- park cars in it
- run the above specified queries

APPROACH

this is a basic approach where an array is needed to store the car details which is model a class
the array is supposed to be of no specified size since using array.fill with size given by user would yield the same
now for storing the car details we need to see if its null or not at the location.
array.fill would yield null to all fields intially here
now we need to check for 2 case while entering first is null and another is if array is full
array full means exiting with message
now for removal for cars we need to create a logic to match the slots and also to check if slots are valid
for rest of the things i can say that simple looping over the array check if array has null skip it if not fulfill condition
